# Iris-Flask-Project

A fully end-to-end data science project that predicts Iris species using a Random Forest classifier. The project covers data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment of the trained model as a Flask web application.

## Introduction

The Iris Flask Project is designed as a complete data science pipeline. It starts with loading and preprocessing the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) to train a Random Forest classifier. The trained model, along with its label encoder, is then used to create a Flask web application. 


 **Educational Value:**  
  The project offers a clear, step-by-step approach to handling data, training models, and deploying them. It serves as a template for beginners and professionals alike, illustrating best practices in data science.
  
- **Real-World Application:**  
  Although the Iris dataset is simple, the techniques demonstrated—such as data cleaning, model evaluation, and Flask deployment—are directly applicable to real-world projects. You can adapt this workflow to larger datasets and more complex models.

- **Deployment & API Integration:**  
  The project shows how to wrap a machine learning model in a Flask application, making it accessible as a web service. This is crucial for integrating AI into production environments where models need to serve real-time predictions.

### How Can It Be Used?
- **Educational Resource:**  
  Use this project as a starting point in data science courses or internships to understand the lifecycle of a machine learning project.
  
- **Prototype for Web Services:**  
  Adapt the provided code to develop your own web applications that offer predictive services. The structure of this project can be scaled and modified for more complex use cases.
